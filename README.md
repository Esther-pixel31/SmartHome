Property Management System

###

What you built
You built a web based system for managing rental properties.
It handles real landlord problems like tracking properties, units, and tenants without spreadsheets or paperwork.

Why it exists
Landlords lose time and money using manual records.
Missed rent, unclear tenant data, and poor follow up happen fast.
This system puts everything in one place and keeps records consistent.

What users do with it
• Create and manage properties
• Add units under each property
• Assign tenants to units
• Control access using user roles
• Work with a secure API
• Scale without changing the data model

What makes it solid
• Built around real workflows
• Clean REST API design
• Strong separation of concerns
• Secure authentication
• Ready for frontend or mobile apps
